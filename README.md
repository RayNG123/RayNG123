# Hi there, This is Yusen(NG) Wu! 👋

I'm a dedicated rising senior undergraduate student at Questrom School of Business in Boston University 🎓, currently undertaking a challenging dual degree program in 1) Mathematics with Specialty in Statistics 📈 and 2) Business Administration with Concentation in Business Analytics 💼. This enriching academic journey allows me to blend the analytical rigor of data with the strategic facets of business.

My research interest is centered around the fascinating crossroads of business and machine learning 🖥️. I'm passionate about leveraging advanced computational methods to tackle complex business problems.

Beyond my reaseach, I love playing snowboarding, soccer, and snooker.

## What I'm currently working on 💻

At present, I'm engrossed in working with large-scale pretrained language models with a focus on their business implications📚. This task enables me to glean valuable insights from unstructured text data like patent corpus 📝, an increasingly important skill in our data-driven era 🌐. I also focused on the use of NLP technoques to counter the spread of misinformation to folster social goods.

## Future Goals 🚀
